Simple Calculator in React

Overview

This project is a simple calculator built using React. It features basic arithmetic operations and a clean user interface. The project highlights why React is preferred over traditional, outdated JavaScript approaches for building modern web applications.

Why React Instead of Traditional JavaScript

1. Component-Based Architecture

React allows us to create reusable components. In this calculator project, the entire calculator is encapsulated in a single Calculator component, which makes the code modular, maintainable, and easy to extend. Traditional JavaScript often leads to spaghetti code as applications grow in complexity.

2. State Management

React provides a built-in state management system using the useState hook. This simplifies handling dynamic data such as the calculator’s input and results. With traditional JavaScript, managing state typically involves manually updating the DOM, which can quickly become error-prone and cumbersome.

3. Declarative Rendering

React's declarative approach makes UI updates predictable and easier to understand. For example, when the user interacts with the calculator, React re-renders only the necessary parts of the UI. Traditional JavaScript often requires direct DOM manipulation with libraries like jQuery, which can lead to inconsistencies and harder-to-debug issues.

4. Separation of Concerns

With React, the logic (JavaScript) and presentation (CSS) are cleanly separated. The styling is contained in a dedicated CSS file, while the functionality is encapsulated within the component. This separation is harder to achieve with traditional JavaScript.

5. Easier Debugging and Testing

React’s developer tools make it easy to inspect components, view state changes, and debug issues. Traditional JavaScript lacks a unified debugging tool for managing UI components and state.

6. Future-Proof Technology

React is actively maintained and supported by a large community, making it a reliable choice for building modern applications. In contrast, traditional JavaScript methods are increasingly becoming obsolete as frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue dominate the development landscape.

Features of the Calculator

Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Clean and responsive user interface.

Modular and scalable design.

CSS styling in a separate file for better maintainability.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

Node.js and npm installed.

Installation

Clone the repository.

Install dependencies:

npm install
